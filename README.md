## The long narrative of Valloc
**See the screenshots below for visuals.**

With Valloc, you can send a link to your favorite public pages to friends, co-workers, fellow students and family members. Your friends can see what is top priority to you and which sites you keep an eye on. Colleagues can share links to frequently used resource sites; perhaps a marketing team would share links to vital trade sites. Students can share valuable links for research and professors can post bookmarks for students to track and use for their studies. Even family members can share links for entertainment, online calendars or websites. 

For privacy, you may have several sites you rely on for personal use, that you do not want exposed to the public. If so, just mark this Valloc page as “private.” On these private pages, you could securely list links perhaps to bank or credit card sites, your favorite shopping sites, social sites and blogs, news – anything goes. 

All your pages are accessible by a URL over the web, and as intuitive as you can make it. This way your URLs are expressive and intuitive and easy to remember, particularly when sharing with others. Here you can have one home page located at your user root, with something like “valloc.com/joe”. Then you can create as many topic pages as desired under a sub-path, such as “valloc.com/joe/hobbies”. Reach the same, simple URL from any mobile device. 

When arranging your pages, public or private, Valloc allows for a quick and easy way through the “Page Designer.” This is a visual arrangement to define your titled links and then drag and drop them onto any location in the page. You can also specify section titles to categorize links on your page. Your interest and needs evolve over time and Valloc tries to accommodate this by providing for easy access into the Page Designer to add, subtract and re-arrange. This way your pages are “living pages” and can evolve as quickly as you do. 

For collaboration at work you want to share links of frequently used websites with your professional team. At school you want to share class resources with students and teachers. With friends and family you want to share the websites most important to you. Share your pages for all these reasons. If you freely want to share your page content then set the visibility to public. Public pages are accessible without signing in. If you need a private page that only you can access after signing in, and also over an encrypted channel, then set your page to private. You can also share private pages by inviting page guests which is helpful when working in teams on confidential material. You can add page guests on the Page Designer by adding other Valloc users by his/her username. If desired, set the Can modify checkbox to allow an individual ability to modify sections and links on the page. Communicate with other team members with note history for each history you share. Have a full conversation based off web document or even a shared DropBox link.
